      <h5 class=" w3-center w3-row-padding w3-white w3-padding-64 w3-container w3-content">As a team, it is important for members to be able to understand and communicate with each other for a smooth workflow. In order to achieve this, tests such as personality tests can have a big impact as it gives an insight on the behaviours of team members and how they operate on doing tasks. With these tests, not only will it allow us to have an insight and better understanding on how our team members deal with different tasks but it can allow us as individuals to be able to learn and adjust to different personalities and working styles.
</h5>

<h5 class=" w3-center w3-row-padding w3-white w3-padding-64 w3-container w3-content">As seen in the graphs, each of us have different personalities and learning styles and from this we would be able to adjust each of ourselves in order to create a suitable working environment for everyone and assign suitable tasks for each member along with this, the knowledge of each member’s personality (16personalities test) would make us be more sensitive towards other members as the test gives an in-depth detail about each of our personalities resulting in better communication in the team overall. With these leading to each of the members having to learn and adjust, getting better understanding and better communication in the team, this would result in the team producing a product/service to a greater degree.

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center"> Most IT professionals start their day with looking at their emails and replying to them, then they usually have a daily stand-up meeting on what they will be working on throughout the day and what the manager is expecting from them by the end of the day. Sometimes they have meetings with the clients if they have any changes to the product they need, this is mostly their daily work, if we look at the start of the project, they have meetings with the product owner, analyst and other team members. Most of the time some new or junior developers work on resolving bugs and make documentation of the products too.

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">Mostly during the day, they interact with their fellow developers, where they are working with junior and senior people, they also work with the data and business analyst, the product owner and analyst is mostly working with the clients and investors and the clients have their own team which is working with the customers. This is mainly for a client-based company. Product based companies have their own team to interact with the customers and explain their product to them.

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center"> During the start of the project, they work on making user stories which means they break a large feature into small parts.

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">The most challenging part comes to a developer is to limit the use of additional services to keep the product under budget, they also must make sure the product is secure, at times there are moments they have to work on project that is premade and is not written by them in past, so understanding that can be a hassle too. Although the job pays well, there is always a pressure of time limit, as they must make sure that the product is delivered on time with full functionality.

      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself from a starting point to a selected destination in a mode called “autopilot”, just like in aeroplanes.  There are also various in-vehicle technologies and sensors, including adaptive cruise control, active steering (steer by wire), anti-lock braking systems (brake by wire), GPS navigation technology, lasers and radar.
      </h5>

      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What is the state of art of autonomous vehicles?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">The state of art of autonomous vehicles is currently abstract. Autonomous vehicles are seen as a promising technology that has the potential to alter mobility and address a variety of traffic challenges, including accessibility, efficiency, convenience, and, most importantly, safety.
      <br>
      Vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines were used in the development of production automobiles. To this day, improvements in internal combustion technology are being made. The advancement of autonomous car technology is accelerating. Autonomous vehicle businesses have invested a significant amount of money in the development of autonomous vehicle technology with the goal of commercialising it.

      </h5>

      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What can be done now?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">It can be said to be a self-driving car. To execute software and move between destinations without a human operator, it uses a combination of sensors, actuators, machine learning systems, and complicated and powerful algorithms. The sensors collect real-time information about the environment, such as geographic coordinates, vehicle speed and direction, acceleration, and potential obstructions. Car navigation is also possible since each vehicle is equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and a geographic information system (GIS) that collects location data such as latitude and longitude. To determine the relative vehicle location, the location system employs an inertial navigation system (INS). Information concerning traffic and road facilities is stored on electronic maps. Path planning is generally accomplished by map matching, which determines the car's location. Three basic modalities are employed to perceive the environment: laser perception, optical perception, and radar perception.
      </h5>

      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What can be done in the future?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">Recent advancements include crash alerts, earlier warnings about accidents, road construction, over-speed, traffic signals, fog warnings, the presence of black ice, and some location-based services, among others. These advancements, as well as advancements in connected vehicle technology can really help make autonomous vehicles fully commercial.
<br><br>
        Autonomous vehicles must learn to recognize a variety of items in their route, ranging from branches and litter to animals and people. Tunnels that interfere with the Global Positioning System , building projects that necessitate lane changes, and difficult judgments, such as where to stop to allow emergency vehicles to pass, are all obstacles on the road.
<br><br>
        The systems must make split-second decisions on when to slow down, swerve, or maintain regular acceleration. Self-driving cars have been reported pausing and swerving excessively when objects are identified in or near the highways, which is a continuing difficulty for developers. Not to mention the other problems that developers have to face.
<br><br>
        Despite the fact that driverless car firms have made incredible progress in the technology, fully autonomous cars will not be available to the general public for many years. At this time, specifying a certain year may not be possible. Despite the fact that technology is evolving, we must be prepared to use it. In order to ensure a smooth growth of technology, the problems mentioned before must also be overcome.

      </h5>


      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What is the likely impact?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">
The creation of autonomous vehicles can bring many benefits, along with all the benefits, it can also bring disadvantages to our society and impact some people in harmful ways. So here are some pros and cons for autonomous vehicles.
<br><br>
The likelihood of widespread usage of self-driving cars has a number of advantages, including a reduction in traffic accidents and the associated economic costs of property damage, injury, and death. These driverless vehicles will also save energy by maximising driving efficiency and reducing traffic congestion. The potential for net economic benefit is substantial. Most fatal car accidents are caused by human errors or bad decisions by humans such as drunk driving or distracted driving. Self-driving cars eliminate those risk variables from the equation, but they are still subject to other factors that cause crashes, such as mechanical faults.
<br><br>
Moreover, it can cause unintended consequences. Unemployment of vehicle drivers can happen as If cars, trucks, and buses start driving themselves, people who earn their living from driving these vehicles will suddenly find themselves out of a job. It will be difficult for these individuals to find new jobs fast, and the cost of retraining them may be prohibitive. One intriguing possibility is that in a few generations' hence, very few people would even know how to operate a car.
<br><br>
It can also affect the automobile industry. There’s a chance that people would increasingly rely on calling a driverless car from a shared fleet, similar to how they would call an Uber, driving a reduction in private car ownership. Why possess an expensive system that is prone to failure when you can just summon a self-driving car to take you anywhere you want, whenever you want? The automobile industry would be destroyed if private car ownership became obsolete, resulting in the loss of many employment, both directly and indirectly, as well as billions of dollars in economic activity.
<br><br>
Another problem with these autonomous vehicles is that hackers are able to take control of the automobiles. Security specialists have successfully hacked and taken control of a Tesla Model S and a Jeep Cherokee in the past, hunting for holes in modern autos. 67
<br><br>
Computer hardware and software would be in charge of a self-driving car. To take control of a car or even force it to crash on purpose, a malicious attacker may locate and exploit security weaknesses in any number of complicated systems.

      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">How will this affect you?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">

        If developers of autonomous vehicles are able to successfully bring these vehicles to be accepted by society and also able to fully commercialise them, then the world of transportation will be completely changed. They might be trying to change all vehicles, public transport and personal vehicles to autonomous vehicles.  Once this happens, other people, just like me, will rely more on it, as it removes human errors and bad  decisions which can’t be improved. On the other hand, if we rely on machines, it can still be fixed or improved. If autonomous vehicles replace all public vehicles (Taxi,Uber,Bus), I would rely on them like they are private vehicles. This removes the need for private  vehicles. In terms of time saving, it might not affect much. On the other hand, safety will be more ensured. This makes family trips a lot more comfortable as you won’t need to rely on finding a trusted driver. My family, just like me and other people will definitely make use of this. Unfortunately, one of my family members does work in an “Uber” type of job in my country and if this happens, everyone involved will be unemployed and even might protest just to get their job back. Overall, autonomous vehicles will have its own pros and cons. Ethically, it might not get accepted as quickly, there might be conflicts here and there. So the presence of autonomous vehicles might not be coming so soon in our daily lives.

      </h1>


      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What does a robot do?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">
        Robot is any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner.
        <br><br>
        Robots help humans with dangerous jobs because they are capable of working in hazardous environments. They can handle lifting heavy loads, toxic substances and repetitive tasks that can last 24/7. This has helped companies to prevent many accidents, also saving time and money.  For example, robots are used in industries to do simple repetitive tasks which are much more efficient.

      </h5>


      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What is the state of the art of robotics?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">


        Robotics is currently in an abstract stage. The history and origins of robotics are examined, as well as the current state of robot progress, its significance, and a new role for robots in human civilization. A review of national research initiatives is presented, as well as some research and development outcomes. In sophisticated countries, the population of robots is rapidly growing, and the societal impact of their spread must be carefully examined. Finally, from the aspect of human society, how to deal with the future robot period is discussed.
<br><br>
        Talking about robots in general, there are hundreds of different robotics designed to help people in different ways and do different tasks. For example, robots can help you cook, then serve the food itself, outrun you, help you see better, prepare your medications, make Music and etc. This shows that robots are already in our daily lives. For now it can help with tasks humans can do but are better fitted for robots. Such as, repetitive tasks and hazardous tasks. When you try to mass produce a product, it requires repetition and a lot of effort. When trying to produce large numbers of products, this means it’ll require more people to produce them. With the help of robots, they can be a replacement for a human and can help with  the production 24/7. It can also help people who have lost their arms or other body parts. Their lost body parts will be replaced by programmed robots trying to mimic the human body.
<br><br>
        Aside from just the basic functions of robots, there are advanced robot technologies and creations. Nanobots are robots that have been reduced down to microscopic size in order to execute a function in very small locations. Nanobots are still in the early stages of development. Nanobots could be implanted into the bloodstream in the future to undertake surgical procedures that are too delicate or complicated for traditional surgery. Nanobots could be used to fight germs by tracking down and destroying individual bacterial cells, such as cancer cells, or they could be used to heal specific organ cells in the body.
<br><br>
        Another example of what robots could be able to perform in the future is space exploration. Future robots will evolve from massive, heavy robots to nanosats, which are small networked robots that can be deployed in the numbers for a low cost. These tiny bots will build a self-organising network that can quickly investigate new regions of interest while also forming larger robots that can mine metals or develop new vehicles for future exploration.
<br><br>
        Robots and other technologies are already in our daily life and will keep on advancing to do more tasks. The possibilities are endless for robotics who know there might be another life changing discovery in the near future.

      <h2 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">What is the likely impact?
      </h2>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">


       Human labour, growth, and advancement have always been aided by technology. As technology has progressed over time, so have we, the humans, from the first stone ax to today's artificial intelligence-driven robots.
<br><br>
        Aside from being accurate and consistent, robots may operate in any setting, increasing their versatility. Because robots can work in hazardous areas, they eliminate risky employment for humans. They are capable of lifting big items, handling dangerous substances, and doing repeated jobs. This has aided businesses in preventing numerous mishaps while also saving time and money. Robots are employed in the medical industry for complex surgeries such as prostate cancer surgery. Robots can reach and fit in places where human hands can't, allowing for more precision. In the medical field, robotic benefits can include less intrusive procedures and reduced discomfort for patients recovering from surgery.
<br><br>
        On the other hand, humans might also be too reliant on robots and become lazy which could impact their health. Other impacts can include potential job losses as robots can work faster and much more accurately. Although, the role of humans is still essential in the industrial revolution.  People affected are usually people that manually help with the production of a product in factories, etc.
<br><br>
        Industry owners will thrive in the long term as they won’t need to pay for so many workers that are not as reliable as robots. They will also get improved quality assurance. Robotic automation eliminates these risks by accurately producing and checking items that meet the required standard without fail. With more products going out the door manufactured to a higher standard, this creates a number of new business possibilities for companies to expand upon.
<br><br>
        In conclusion, robots are changing our lives day by day without you ever realising. Everywhere around the world advancements and discoveries are being made to help humans with their jobs. Robotic evolution has become an important factor in every human’s life.

        The presence of robots has already been accepted by society a long time ago. From children to elders, they have been using services provided by machines for quite some time. These advancements are seen as helpful and positive by most people. Restaurants can now serve food automatically from the kitchen. Health care for elders can also be provided by robots. It's already obvious that robots and AI are already making an impact in everyone’s lives including mine. For example, the house cleaner robot my family owns, we can live in the house without having to worry about no one cleaning it. With the help of robots, my family doesn't have to hire maids that are unreliable and inefficient.
<br><br>
        Overall the existence of robots has helped me, my family and friends in a positive way. We can only wait for future advancements to come and is excited to wait for it.

      <h1 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">ARDUINO
      </h1>


      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">
        Arduino is an open-source gadgets stage in view of simple-to-utilise equipment and programming. Arduino itself isn’t a microcontroller but the chip on the board is and this chip is able to read inputs from sensors, buttons, messages and more and produce outputs such as activating a LED light, activating a motor, creating files and more. In order for the board to do certain tasks, the user must send a set of instructions to the microcontroller which is done by creating and sending the code using the Arduino programming language via the Arduino Software(IDE)
<br><br>
        Studies of the use of arduino is currently still very limited. However, the device   at the moment is commonly being used for developing computing devices as it features great sensing and controlling capabilities hence being popular among hobbyists, prototypers and people who are new to the robotics field. Although the device is not really known among businesses, plans for its use in business to reduce cost in terms of prototyping a product which would allow companies to have more time and money to go over other parts in the development process which would result in a product of a greater degree. Along with this, plans for using Arduino to do tasks common remote sensor networks won’t be able to is being discussed as this would give businesses the advantage of having new strategies to create a higher quality of environment in the workplace. Other than businesses, future plans for the Arduino to be used in developing countries are being considered. These plans do include devices to do tasks in the medical field to the manufacturing field.
<br><br>
        The development of Arduino will greatly impact a lot of people and would bring a lot of benefits. Not only does it reduce costs for many development steps in producing a product or service but it could bring a lot of new possibilities and functionality that would improve the quality of life for people whether it is personal or in the workplace. It would also greatly affect how businesses operate, with the benefit of being low-cost and taking less time, it would allow businesses to be much more efficient which could decrease the time and cost it takes for a product to be made and increase its quality and functionality which would give greater customer satisfaction, increasing sales and ratings. Arduino may replace previous technologies,an example would be SCADA systems, SCADA systems are generally involve equipments that are usually very expensive or are under a certain ownership which could bring unnecessary complications especially in remote locations, with arduino, the tasks that are done by these systems such as monitoring and controlling could be done at a much cost-effective way. Arduino may also create new jobs, because not a lot of people have knowledge or experience with working with arduino, it would create jobs as it would require people specialised in working with this device to program and maintain it.
<br><br>
        Arduino could create day-to-day tasks to be done automatically hence saving time and allowing us to be able to spend more time on other things. It can also take the pain in having to do simple or repetitive tasks which would give a great impact on our life and towards our friends and family.

      <h1 class="w3-padding-64 w3-center">CHATTERBOT
      </h1>

      <h5 class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-32 w3-container w3-center">
  Chatterbot is an artificial intelligence program that is used to replicate usual conversations a user would have with another person. It is usually used in situations where conversational pieces are required, an example would be customer service and would be in the form of either text or Text-To-Speech(TTS).
<br><br>
  Chatterbot is a machine learning program which usually uses sophisticated AI, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) or extensive word processing while other chatterbots may use the method of searching a specific phrase to generate a response. Chatterbot is very common on websites whether it becomes like an assistant or just a FAQs platform. With its capability of NLU, it can process an input in natural language and give an appropriate response and would not need the developers to list all possible expressions the user may input. Along with NLU, chatterbot is able to hold contextual conversation which means that it does not only hold value in the current input but it also holds value in previous inputs and responses. As humans, contextual conversation is very common as we tend to be dependent on context to hold a proper conversation where both parties understand one another. Chatterbot today can memorise simple things like the user’s name, age or gender if it was mentioned but it still has trouble in memorising other things they may have talked about and plans so that the chatterbot would eventually be able to remember what it and the user may have talked about are currently being discussed and developed. Since some chatterbots are based on an AI, these chatterbots are able to learn from given contents or websites.
<br><br>
  With that being said, these features would impact the industry greatly. With NLU, the bot would be able to create responses that would match the current context which would save time and money for developers as they would not need to list possible expressions and work on other segments to create a better program which would lead to better customer experience. Contextual conversation would also create a chatting environment in which the user would feel comfortable which would also lead to better customer experience. Having the chatterbot be able to utilise the data log and memorise what it and the user may have talked about and self-learn would be beneficial too as it would be able to adjust easily into the conversation and increase the quality of customer experience.
<br><br>
  With the presence and the current continuous development of chatterbots, this would affect day-to-day tasks. As chatterbots are also available in a text or text-to-speech form, we would be able to ask and receive information easily. An example of a chatterbot that is popular and used often in today’s society is Google Assistant, this chatterbot is easily accessible as people would only need to say ‘Ok Google’ to activate it on their devices and from there they can ask or say anything. These chatterbots would save time for people and reduce risks that may occur as they would not need to take the time to fully focus on opening their device to get the information they need hence reducing risks that may occur when we are multitasking. An example of this would be trying to get directions via a GPS app like Google Maps or Apple Maps while driving, instead of having to risk getting into an accident by having to unlock our mobile phones, we would just need to say a certain phrase to activate the chatterbot and from there we can just ask the bot to get directions to our destination.
